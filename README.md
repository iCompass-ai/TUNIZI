# What is TUNIZI?

This work presents the largest dataset dedicated for the Tunisian Arabizi, annotated as positive, negative, and neutral and preprocessed for Sentiment Analysis subtask.
Tunizi is the first 100% Tunisian Arabizi Sentiment Analysis dataset. 
Tunisian Arabizi is the representation of the tunisian dialect written in Latin characters and numbers rather than Arabic letters.
This type of writing is most used on social media platformssince it presents an easier way to communicate. 
Also, since the Tunisian dialect already contains French and English words, people tend to use Tu-nizi for easier typing of non formal texts. 

# Collection & Preprocessing & Annotation

Tunizi dataset contains two versions, that are Common-Crawl-based extracted from social media.
The datasets are representative and include different topics. However, thety do not include any confidential information. 
All sentences were manually annotated by Tunisian native speakers at a higher education level (Master/PhD).
The collection, preprocessing, and annotation is the same for the two versions of the dataset.
